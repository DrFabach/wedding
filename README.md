> at least it will have its Shiny app.

## Highlights 

- Secure access via a login and password authentication system 
- Information about the wedding day (schedule, accomodation, etc.)
- RSVP feature where guests can specify their presence at the different times of the wedding, their choice for the diner menu and their diet
- Dashboard _- only accessible with login and password -_ where bride/grooms can manage the preparations for their wedding (guests, expenses, table plan)
- Data stored in Google sheets
- Design in line with the wedding announcement (colors, fonts, etc.) 

## Data

The application is based on two datasets stored on Google Drive:

  - *data\_guests*: contains information about your guests (name,
    attendance at the vin dâ€™honneur, attendance at the dinner,
    attendance at the return on Sunday lunch, special diet, etc.)
  - *data\_expenses*: contains information about the wedding expenses
    (venue, caterer, groomâ€™s outfit, wedding rings, etc.)

The datasets are updated according to the userâ€™s navigation in the app.

## Install & launch the demo

You can install the development version of {wedding} from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/wedding")
```

To launch the demo version, you will need to create a token to access
the sample data stored on Google Drive:

``` r
# install.packages(c("gargle", "googledrive"))
Sys.setenv(GOOGLE_MAIL = "wedding.r.package@gmail.com") # then restart R
options(gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets")
options(gargle_quiet = FALSE)
googledrive::drive_auth(cache = ".secrets", 
                        email = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAIL"))
```

Then run the app:

``` r
wedding::run_app()
```
