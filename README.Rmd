{wedding} helps you to prepare and manage your wedding `r emo::ji("bride_with_veil")``r emo::ji("bride_with_veil")` - `r emo::ji("bride_with_veil")``r emo::ji("man_in_tuxedo")` - `r emo::ji("man_in_tuxedo")``r emo::ji("man_in_tuxedo")`

> Your wedding may be postponed several times because of the covid, but at least it will have its Shiny app.
## Demo

An example of the app is available here: http://connect.thinkr.fr/wedding/

Login to access the app: _welcome_ <br />
Password to access the app: _bigday_ <br />
Password to access the tab dedicated to brides/grooms: _onlyforbride_

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/home-page.png")
```

## Data

The application is based on two datasets stored on Google Drive: 

- _data_guests_: contains information about your guests (name, attendance at the vin d'honneur, attendance at the dinner, attendance at the return on Sunday lunch, special diet, etc.)
- _data_expenses_: contains information about the wedding expenses (venue, caterer, groom's outfit, wedding rings, etc.)

The datasets are updated according to the user's navigation in the app.

## Install & launch the demo

You can install the development version of {wedding} from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/wedding")
```

To launch the demo version, you will need to create a token to access the sample data stored on Google Drive:

``` r
# install.packages(c("gargle", "googledrive"))
Sys.setenv(GOOGLE_MAIL = "wedding.r.package@gmail.com") # then restart R
options(gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets")
options(gargle_quiet = FALSE)
googledrive::drive_auth(cache = ".secrets", 
                        email = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAIL"))
```

Then run the app: 

``` r
wedding::run_app()
```
